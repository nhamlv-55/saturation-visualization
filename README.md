# How to run
## Using the prebuilt frontend
You can download the prebuilt from here
[https://github.com/nhamlv-55/SatVisPreBuild/tree/iterative_mode](https://github.com/nhamlv-55/SatVisPreBuild/tree/iterative_mode)
Then you can serve it using

`python3 -m http.server 2112`

The Visualizer will be served at `localhost:2112`. But you also need to setup your backend.

## Setup and run the backend
You will need a customized version of Z3

[https://github.com/agurfinkel/z3/tree/vis](https://github.com/agurfinkel/z3/tree/vis)

and a customed Z3 Wrapper for the backend

[https://github.com/nhamlv-55/deepSpacer](https://github.com/nhamlv-55/deepSpacer)

Edit the `start_backend.sh` to point to `$Z3_PATH` and `$Z3_BIN`. Then run 
`./start_backend.sh`. If you don't have `deepSpacer`, the script will clone it for you.

Running this script will serve the backend at localhost:5000. The frontend should point to this backend.

If using other port, change this line in `visualization-frontend/src/components/App.tsx`

`        const fetchedJSON = await fetch(mode === "manualcs" ? 'http://localhost:5000/spacer/startmanualcs' : 'http://localhost:5000/spacer/start', {`


# How to develop

## Requirements
* nodejs
* npm

## High level description
We need 3 components to run this:

* A customed Z3 version (to dump the trace in the format the Backend expects)

[https://github.com/agurfinkel/z3/tree/vis](https://github.com/agurfinkel/z3/tree/vis)

* The Backend

[https://github.com/nhamlv-55/deepSpacer/tree/iterative_mode](https://github.com/nhamlv-55/deepSpacer/tree/iterative_mode)

* The Frontend (this repo)

## Setup and run the frontend (dev mode)
`./start_frontend.sh`

Running this script will serve the frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Note that even if the browser is popped up, the compilation process is still running, so it will take a while.
