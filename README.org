* How to Run
** Front end
   [[https://nhamlv-55.github.io/spacer-visualization]]

** Backend
   - copy the =docker-compose.yml= to a local directory of your choosing
   - run the following command to spin up both containers for the backend
     =docker-compose up=
   

* How to develop
** Requirements
   - nodejs
   - npm
     
** High Level Description
   
We need 3 components to run this:

*** Z3
    [[https://github.com/agurfinkel/z3]]
    - Note: there is a version of z3 being pulled to the relevant containers

*** The Vis Backend
    [[https://github.com/aishr/SpacerVisBackend]]
    
    Docker Container: [[https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/aishr/spacer-vis-backend]] 

*** [OPTIONAL] The Prose Backend
    - Note: Some secondary features will not work without this backend
    - Note: you need to request access to the repo

    [[https://github.com/aishr/SpacerProseBackend]]

    Docker Container: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/aishr/spacer-prose-backend

*** The Frontend (this repo)
    - Setup and run the frontend (dev mode)
    =./start_frontend.sh=

    Running this script will serve the frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

    Note that even if the browser is popped up, the compilation process is still running, so it will take a while.
